    <!-- Basically i have a main website that is to bo used for hosting 
    but damn hosting is costly but the domains are cheaper i think 
    of bying a rasbery pi and host it in that but then complication 
    occurs that i dont have a wifi at home ,in hosting providers i 
    really dont need pre existing services i want to establish it 
    from scratch using linux server ...some times i think of 
    requesting a server from college but idk they are dumbass  -->
